1
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
The late fourth century A.D. the 
Roman Empire began to crumble.

2
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,700
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt,
still retained some of its lustre,...

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
...possessed one of the Seven 
Wonders of the ancient world:...

4
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,200
...the legendary lighthouse, 
and the biggest library known.

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,800
The library was a not only 
cultural but a religious symbol,...

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
a place where the pagans worshiped 
their ancestral gods.

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,400
The traditional pagan worship 
in the city now coexisted...

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,900
...with the Jews, and an unstoppable 
religion up to now banned,...

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,900
...Christianity.

10
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Library of Alexandria, 391 A.D.

11
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,900
After taking the library, many 
pagans were converted...

12
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,900
Hipatia continued teaching and 
researching,...

13
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,900
...while his former students held...

14
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,900
...important positions in the 
social elite.

15
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,900
The empire was split in two forever.

16
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Many Christians saw this as a 
sign of the end of the world...

17
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
...and decided to prepare by 
practicing a more holy life.

18
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,400
The order of "Parabolanos" monks 
was charged to go...

19
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,900
...through the streets and watch
for Christian morality...

20
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,000
...now uneven by the presence
of the Jews.

21
00:56:55,400 --> 00:01:21,400
The Library, years later.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,000
How many fools
have wondered 

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,700
why not the stars fall
from the sky 

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
<i> But you,
not happy to cease of the wise, </i>

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,300
<i> You know that the stars
do not move up or down. </i>

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
only reborn <i>
from east to west, </i>

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,500
<i> following the most perfect post
ever can see , </i>

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,300
<i> circle. </i>

29
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Because the circle <i> reigns 
in heaven, </i>

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,200
<i> the stars would never have fallen
and never will. </i>

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,000
But what about here on Earth?

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,900
Here, bodies do fall.

33
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,100
But their movements
are not circular but linear.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,500
Look again.

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,400
Again.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,000
No, leave it.

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,700
So,

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
<i> What mysterious wonder 
do you would think </i>

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,000
<i> that may lurk beneath the earth
for every single person and animal, </i>

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,900
<i> and object and all laid exact
on there</i>

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
What may should be?

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,400
The highness, madame.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,700
No.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,300
Sinesio.

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,900
The weighty.

46
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,000
<i> No, you both speaking about the same thing,
but you not talking about primary course. </i>

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Has anyone ever thought about
your..

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,700
your feet ...

49
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,000
your feet

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,400
<i> standing perched on the
very center of the cosmos </i>

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,200
that holds all things together,
pull them together

52
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,200
If there is no center,
the universe would be

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,200
deformed, infinite, formless,

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,700
<i> chaotic. </i>

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,200
Doesn't matter that we were <i>
here, there or anywhere </i>

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,600
What you will do? That's right
never being born

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Library of Alexandria 391 AD

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
God, Our Father,

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
lord of the universe,

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
origin of all things,

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,100
eternal force of the cosmos,

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,100
where everything has
its beginning and its end.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,900
Mighty Serapis,
Isis, Horus,

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,600
And all the gods Anubis
that protect us

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,100
both in heaven
and on earth ...

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,700
Something happens in the market.

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,100
I know you also feel something.
I've seen.

68
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,100
Tell the master that we leave.

69
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Can you believe. He was counting me
as the part of their conquests

70
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,200
This Orestes also foolish
as his father.

71
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,200
I have already suggested that you take
his heart to another muse

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,900
one more beautiful than me.

73
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,200
- Who?
The music.

74
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,200
<i> Music </i>

75
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,500
He find his music.

76
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,000
What happen 227 had become 
16 ?

77
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Divide  with 14.

78
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,900
<i> They behave like humans!
Eat, drink and fornicate! </i>

79
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,000
If my gods <i> eat, drink
and fornicate, good for them </i>

80
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,500
Know this,

81
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,700
you who console yourself
with pagan images.

82
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,600
Men, women,
birds, reptiles!

83
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Serapis!

84
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,100
Serapis! Who could trust
the God, need a flower pot

85
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,000
for crown?

86
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,300
Hey You, Christians, how arrogant you 
to take another

87
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,800
Empire attitude like this

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,700
My father's father saw them

89
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,800
slaughtered at the circus

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
and ate to the lions.

91
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Enough! Watch.

92
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
Watch.

93
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,800
You see now 
I walk cross the fire.

94
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,300
If my god ...

95
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,400
If my God is the true god,
I unscathed, no hurt.

96
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
And if your gods exist,

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
<i> they'll roast me like a pig. </i>

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,100
You ...

99
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,300
You're lie!

100
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,900
You'll burn!

101
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,200
You will have what you deserve!

102
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,400
Let's see if you can walk cross
the fire.

103
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,200
What are you doing?

104
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
<i> Stop, you can not do that!
Leave him alone. </i>

105
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,500
<i> Quiet! or you will follow. </i>

106
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,300
Who is this?

107
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,500
Who is this?

108
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,000
How many times should I
must repeat message?

109
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Today,

110
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,800
Christians
burn a man.

111
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Right in the middle of agora!

112
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,200
I will not have this in my house!

113
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,700
Not in the house of Theon!

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,300
Give it to me.

115
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,400
Give it to me!

116
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,900
No terrific mercy is way go

117
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
- Davo!
Get up.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
You have nothing to do
with this.

119
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,700
I do, i am a Christian.

120
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,200
<i> What did you say? </i>

121
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,200
I do. I am a Christian
Punish both of us.

122
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,800
So, now we'll presume to teach
us a mercy

123
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Get a whip.
- Father!

124
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,300
Calm ...

125
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,300
Father, I beg you.
I begged you

126
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
wrapped in.. in blazing, right?

127
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,400
To the flames, stupid.

128
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,800
<i> Why did not you burned like the heathen?
Tell me. </i>

129
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,600
Leave us ...

130
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,800
Come here.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,300
Kneel.

132
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,700
<i> Tell me, is true
you are a Christian? </i>

133
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,900
I do not know what to say, madame.
- Why not?

134
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,400
If i say yes, that will be a lie

135
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,300
If I said no, i lied to
my master and I do not know which is worse.

136
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,300
Then say nothing.

137
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,800
That's it.

138
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,200
Thank you.

139
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,400
<i> The master is very angry
himself. </i>

140
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,000
What is that?

141
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,900
Something I've done.

142
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,100
<i> looks like a ...</i>

143
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,900
What is it?

144
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,700
<i> the Ptolemaic system. </i>

145
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,400
Yes it is.

146
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,100
Have you done?

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Earth

148
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,300
is the center of the cosmos

149
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,700
and revolve around

150
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,500
the sun

151
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,200
and the five wanderers: Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

152
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,800
Never disobeying
the law of the circle.Never

153
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,400
Ptolemy
told me show as do obey.

154
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
affected if you see them move

155
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
<i> in a loop </i>

156
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,500
<i> is the Join effect of
two circles. </i>

157
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,100
One

158
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,700
travel around the Earth

159
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,200
and the smaller circle

160
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,300
<i> own each wandering. </i>

161
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,900
Loop, the epicycles
"say you see is not happen on the earth"

162
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,600
but our eyes
deceive us.

163
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,700
Well search, Davo.

164
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I like you do the explanation search even 
paying course attention or not

165
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,600
One or two..up here

166
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,800
I tell you The Gods should consulted
to me before they creating anything.

167
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,900
Why say that?

168
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
<i> It's all so whimsical! </i>

169
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,300
Why is the joint take of
two circles?

170
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,000
Would not be more, perfect
if the wander is..

171
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
if wander and a single circle
give sense to everything?

172
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
What authority do you judge
the work of God?

173
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,700
What is wrong with you, Christians?

174
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,100
The man is no longer with brief mouth
in this city

175
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,800
Could you decide creation, you could decide
a Lord, 

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,300
and you offended.
You should move to the desert.

177
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,300
You will not hear anything offensive there.

178
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,800
You know nothing about you speak.
None of you.

179
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,500
What this.. you can explain to all?

180
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,800
What is the question?

181
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,400
Just.. answer me.

182
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,000
<i> If ...</i>

183
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,200
<i> if two things are equal
a third thing, </i>

184
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
and They are all equal to each other

185
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,900
Well.

186
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,100
Now, Are you are not similar to me?

187
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,900
Yes

188
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,600
And you, Orestes?

189
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,900
Yes

190
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,100
Now I am actually say with everybody 
here in this room, 

191
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
More things you joint us 

192
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,300
and divide us.

193
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,800
<i> Whatever happens on the street,
we are brothers. </i>

194
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,300
We are brothers.

195
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,200
Did you remember, the fights are a thing
of slaves and rabble.

196
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Now We should give Davo's presentation
well applause

197
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,900
We will judge all
a live and dead!

198
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,200
And then it will be too late,

199
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,100
because only those who believed in Jesus

200
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,800
we'll be saved.

201
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
What are you waiting for?

202
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,200
What are you waiting for?

203
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,400
<i> The Kingdom of God is near. </i>

204
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,400
Do you understand what 
I am telling to you?

205
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,800
Yes

206
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Do You understand like man do

207
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,000
<i> or do you not had, like sheep? </i>

208
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,000
What are you looking there?

209
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,900
Yes, you.

210
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,700
What are you looking here?

211
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,100
Are you Ammonius,

212
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,900
who made the miracle?

213
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,800
Do you want to see a miracle?

214
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,000
Are you the one?

215
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,400
I am.

216
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,200
Come with me.

217
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,500
Jesus traveled throughout Galilee

218
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,800
teaching in their synagogues.

219
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,500
Preaching the good news
for you

220
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,600
and curing diseases

and people came to see him
worldwide.

223
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800

Bishop.

225
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,800
For theirs is the Kingdom
of Heaven.

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,400
Blessed are they that mourn

227

<i> they shall be comforted. </i>

228

for they shall inherit the earth.

230

The Lord be with you.

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,900
And you, parabolans.

239

I have to pay that
with my own money!

247
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,900
What do you need the money for?

248
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,500
Look at the faces.

in the harmony of it sound.

289
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,500

No, could be death to her.

308
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,400
It's true.
Her work is admirable.

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,600
Yes wise and virtuous.

310
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,800
But Theon,

311

<i> And today I want to give 
something back. </i>

325
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,600
This is for you.

326
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,300
It is the blood of my cycle.

327
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,700
Orestes <i> ...</i>

328
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,000
You say you have found <i>
harmony in me. </i>

329
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,800
Then I suggesting you look out elsewhere
because i think is very little harmony on you

330
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,600
or beauty in that.

331
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,000
<i> Do not you agree? </i>

332
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,100
Yesterday we were discussing
the Apollonius cone.

333
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,700
We speak of the circle,
of the ellipse and parabola.

334
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,400
Today we see the hyperbola.
- Lady!

335
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,300
<i> Forgive me, Lady. </i>

336
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,900
Olimpios requires your present

337
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
urgently to Serapeum.

338
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,600
To you as well.

339
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,800
Thank you, Lord.
Thank you, Lord.

340
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,800
Thank you, Lord.

341
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,600
How is to enjoy that make us
swallow the faith

342
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,500
and customs the people until 
recently were coming out rule?

343
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,500
- What happened?
- It's a sacrilege!

344
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,400
Christians
have met in the agora.

345
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,400
They mocking the gods.

346
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,900
Must stop
these insults!

347
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,400
He may not fear him,

348
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,500
But fear our swords!

349
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Wait!

350
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Wait!

351
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,100
What is it you are going to do?

352
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,700
Are you going to attack them?

353
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,400
Are you going to staying your hands 
with blood for an insult?

354
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,500
The gods!
An insult to

355
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,800
the gods!

356
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,000
If you feel so bad,
Report them to the prefect.

357
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,200
It might seem that you protecting them.

358
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,200
i try to protect
our disciples.

359
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,600
You, who are inciting them to be murderers.

360
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,300
Theon, as director,
you have the last word.

361
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,800
The insult must to be answered.

362
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,800
The Jews can do what they
want, is not your battle.

363
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,400
Ask to your Christians, you would do well
join us with your rank.

364
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,000
You will not caused my disciples
out of this house!

365
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,700
- Glory to Serapis!
- Now all the gods!

Wait for my command!

367
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,900
No one should suspect

368
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,300
<i> for slaves!
Slaves present yourselves </i>

369
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,400

Davo, back.

373
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,800
Glory to Serapis!

374
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,300
Let us listen now!

375
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,700
Do you hear her complain?

376
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,200
No!

377
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,700
This one have no voice too!

378
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,700
Their mouths do not speak,

379
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,600
their eyes do not see,

380
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,600
his nose does not smell.

381
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Still pagans
until they kneel before them!

382
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,600
What madness is this?

383
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,700
By the gods!

384
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,300
Medoro!

385
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,800
Take care of your master!
Protect it..!

386
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,600
God is one!

387
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,500
Death for the heathens!

388
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,500
You! What are you looking that?
Keep fight!

389
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
A fight!

390

<i> Are you deaf?
I said that to fight </i>

391
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,400
I am a Christian!

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,100
I am a Christian!

393
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,400
I am a Christian!

394
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,300
- What is Christ?

395
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,700
Death to the heathens!

No problem. No problem.

What happened?

404
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,000
It was his slave.

405
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,400
Davo, bring rags and water, quickly.

406
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,100
Father <i> ...</i>

00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,400
Synesius, we must leave here.

408
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
Hold it.

409
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,100
Parabolans are coming!

410
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,400
<i> God is with us! </i>

411
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,700
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

413
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,400
May the gods protect them.

414
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,400
Close the gate..!

415
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,400
<i> Do not kill him! It will be a hostage,
like the others. Did you hear everyone? </i>

416
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,900
Any Christian that you catch 

417
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,300
to be a hostage.

418
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Take the our injured to the temple
and Christians

419
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,100
to the basement. Anyone had good eye, good aim 
up on the walls.

420
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,500
Olimpio.

421
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,200
This one is Christian.

422
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Yes, and these three as well.

423
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,300
If you are Christian,
go to the basement.

424
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,700
Olimpios...

425
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,800
is my brothers, I will go as
prisoner with them.

426
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,800
If necessary, so do that.

427
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,800
If anyone,

428
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
anyone,

429
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,600
dares laying finger on
one of my brothers,

430
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I swear I will cross.

431
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,800
Look!

432
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,900
Look at this!

433
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,500
Orestes.

434
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,400
Thank you.

435
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,800
When is 

436
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,200
so many Christians?

437
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,700
We will have to negotiate.

438
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,000
Tell me what can we expect
of a Christian emperor

439
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800
except we put the soul

440
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,200
<i> accept positive still being alive
that's it. </i>

441
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
This is fine.

442
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,800
Nobody leaves
the group, please.

443
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,500
Are they going to pray all night?

444
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,200
Davo.

445
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,700
Stay here.

446
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,200
It's save here.

447
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,200
Just stay with him.

448
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,700
Synesius! What are you doing?

449
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,200
Lady, sister and mother,

498
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,800
should be simple.

499
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,200
So am I right or..?

500
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,500
what if ...

501
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,100
What if there were simple
explanation about the wanders

502
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,800
There is.

503
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,300
But it's so absurd, so old

504
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,900
<i> that no one is give it credit. </i>

505
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,300
What theory is that?

506
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,800
Theory Aristarchus 

507
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,400
Aristarchus argued

508
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,200
that the earth moves.

509
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,100
The behavior of the wandering

510
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,100
is only an optical illusion

511
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,100
produced by our movement

512
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,400
in combination with his
around the sun.

513
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,800
<i>-A heliocentric model.
That's right. </i>

514
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,800
<i> The sun would be at the center, </i>

515
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,900
<i> as it his deal
King of the stars. </i>

516
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,100
And make as just.. be another wanderer.
His work was lost

517
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,400
in the fire that destroyed
mother's library.

518
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,200
That's way we have to take great 
care of this place.

519
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,500
<i> Our library </i>

520
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,700
is all that remains
the wisdom of men.

521
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,500
<i> But every time dropping an object ...</i>

522
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
Who speaks?

523
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,200
Forgive me mistress, love.

524
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,800
<i> i was listening. </i>

525
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,900
Speak up, Davo.

526
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,600
If the earth is moving,

527
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,700
every time dropping an object,

528
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,000
should fall further behind.

529
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,900
And the wind always blow
against us.

530
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,900
And the birds would be wipe on.

531
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,800
I told you

532
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,300
the hypothesis of Aristarchus
that no sense at all.

533
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,400
I feel that what you said
be refuted.

534
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,500
But right now I do not know how.

535
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,100
Make way for the prefect!

536
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,900
Make way!

537
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
Make way for the prefect!

538
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,500
Make way!

539
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,200
Listen everyone!

540

And they will be escorted
to their homes.

Obey immediately!

Send half a regiment

We will send the rest later.

561
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,200
Yes, sir.

562
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,100

563
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,400

568
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,100

Go.

618

From now on, in Alexandria

619
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,500
only permitted ceremonies
Christian and Jewish.

<i> pagan sacrifices, </i>

are prohibited.

623

Damn Jews!

00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,100
They're just a bunch of thugs,
a bunch of animals.

628
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,900
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

629
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,600
Let Bishop Cyril
begun his own depend.

630
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,300
Prefect

631
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,200
our blessed parabolans,

632
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,100
Hung hi has just called

633
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,200
<i> me..? the bird, </i>

634
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,500
default them self ..
strong enough to carry loads

635
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,500
repel, six,
levers ...

636
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,900
And stones!

637
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,700
Prefect can carry stones.

638
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,300
I know they was enter the theater

639
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,400
and stoned knowing we'll do nothing
to defend

640
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,800
Non sense. Because it is the Sabbath!

641
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,200
On the Sabbath you should
honor God

642
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,000
in your synagogues
instead stopping yourself

643
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,700
set in theater.

644
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,200
Therefore I showered stones.

645
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,100
<i> Prefect, you hear that?
Now he threatened us. It is too much..</i>

646
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,400
Friends, there are more things that unite
us than divide us.

647
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,600
We are brothers!
We are all brothers

648
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,700
Where would you Christians be

649
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,900
without the Jews?
Jesus was a Jew!

650
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,300
Jesus was Jewish!

651
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,200
There is .a .something I find

652
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,200
stubbing what You've told.

653
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
- What?
Well,

654
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,100
Why Cyril begin
to cleaning up the city?

655
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,400
is he not satisfied
with what they already have?

656
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,600
He just wants to scare the Jews.

657
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,500
but why you say then before..

658
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,800
What if really interesting.. you
and not them?

659
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,600
Me?

660
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,400
Why?
I'm as Christian as he.

661
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,500
Yes, but forget

662
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,500
that many of your friends
that circle are not.

663
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,500
A full sail, prefect.

664
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500
Lets go.

665
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,800
-Aspasius, you ready?
Yes, mistress.

666
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,900
I would like you to take the sack
and flying to top the mast.

667
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,800
And now, Lady,

668
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,700
Will you finally tell me what 
the point?

669
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,100
When Aspasius

670
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,100
drop the sack, the boat
will be moving forward.

671
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,600
Therefore, the sack

672
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,400
not fall at the foot of the mast,

673
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,600
but will fall further back.
About ...

674
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,600
here.

675
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,800
And what's so special about that?

676
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,800
- Yes!
- But You're wrong!

677
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yes, but this is definitely 
proved

678
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,700
<i> definitive. The sack </i>

679
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,600
has behaved as if
the boat stationary.

680
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,400
<i> What does that mean? </i>

681
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,400
 i do not know.

682
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,700
But the same principle can 
be applied to the Earth.

683
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,500
we could be moving around the sun
without our knowledge.

684
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,400
<i>-Aristarchus.
Exactly. </i>

685
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,000
Why are you troubled yourself
by that, Lady?

686
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,700
Ptolemy <i> not perfect, </i>

687
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,400
but it works.

688
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,600
Orestes, as this with you warrior ...

689
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,800
A few years ago you was not
so pragmatic, prefect.

690
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,600
A few years ago i spoke first
before thinking.

691
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,300
I have Cepheus <i> third. </i>

692
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,200
37.

693
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,200
48.

694
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,700
Venus and Mars

695
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,500
share house in Aquarius.

696
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,600
My father would have celebrated
something like a good wine.

697
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,400
The stars will not fall.
- Really?

698
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,200
<i> No, because they are subject
to the hood. </i>

699
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,600
<i> The lid opens two heart
and Jesus will appear. </i>

700
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,300
What chance for you talking about?

701
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,100
Do not you know that the universe
is a huge chest, don't you?

702
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,500
They laid on top
and the Earth ground.

703
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,700
In this idiot not been told
that the Earth is round!

704
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,500
The Earth is flat.

705
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,700
Your head is really flat.

706
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,400
Read the Scriptures!

707
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,600
If the earth is round,

708
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,600
Why not the people that live 
in the bottom, fall out?

709
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,800
What about the one sides?

710
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,900
Why not slip?

711
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,200
Think about it.

712
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,200
Davo knows.

713
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,700
hi Brother.

714
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,100
What do you say?

715
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,100
Does the earth is flat or round?

716
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,200
Only God knows these things.

717
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,800
Leave them in the ground!

718
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,600
Where they are belong!

719
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,500
Lady, do not despair.

720
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Today in the boat you make
great progress.

721
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:09,000
Why do the wandering very 
that rightness

722
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,400
so unexpected?

723
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,500
And what is worse,

724
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,600
Why does the sun?

725
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,600
Why is change size
summer to winter?

726
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,500
Perhaps it's because

727
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,200
<i> sometimes is nearer </i>

728
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,800
and sometimes farther?

729
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,200
But Aspasia

730
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,400
watch.

731
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,500
According Aristarchus, the sun must be

732
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,200
in the center of everything.

733
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,300
With us, the Earth,

734
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,400
traveling in a circle around him.

735
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,500
Therefore,

736
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,400
and this is the key

737
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,800
We are always exactly

738
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,500
same ...

739
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,400
distance.

740
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,700
If, as you say,
accept that changes the distance,

741
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,600
that forces us to add

742
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,800
epicycle into orbit
Earth.

743
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,800
<i> To be closer
and then farther away. </i>

744
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,300
Now then we fall
in the same trap as Ptolemy.

745
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,100
<i>-circles upon circles.
- Exactly! </i>

746
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,600
I do not know how to solve
this conflict.

747
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,800
<i> let me know we can do it </i>

748
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,300
<i> if shifting the center  ..well.</i>

749
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,500
<i> And not having a center </i>

750
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,600
My heart, Aspasia.

751
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,700
So,

752
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,200
What do we do?

753
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,000
Resting, lady.

754
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,200
Parabolans!

755
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,900
- Parabolans!
- What happens?

756
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,200
<i> parabolans, quick!
Help! </i>

757
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,100
San Alejandro is on fire!

758
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,700
It is a fire.

759
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,400
Come on!

760
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,700
Gather water! The cube!
Take it!

761
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,400
Hurry!

762
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,300
Hurry!

763
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,100
Come, come!

764
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,100
Parabolans!

765
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,700
Parabolans!

766
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,500
Parabolans, quick!

767
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,500
Where's the fire?

768
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,500
Where's the fire?

769
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,100
Jews! It's a trap.

770
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,700
It's a trap!

771
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,700
Christians all

772
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,100
last night is one night was deplorable.

773
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,400
Now I say to you .

774
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,200
Grave no longer
for our dead brothers.

775
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,700
weep not.

776
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,400
Said you killed for the others,

777
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,300
but they are executioners.

778
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,700
Yes, yes.

779
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,700
Weep for them.
Then they

780
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,000
they know neither God,

781
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,500
neither love nor holiness.

782
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,700
I do not know.

783
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,600
because in this day

784
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,100
who repeated the Scriptures
without understanding at all.

785
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,500
It is they who saw
only a man

786
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,400
when the Son of God
standing on the front of us.

787
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,200
And it is they who

788
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,700
<i> in their blindness mocked Him
and crucified him. </i>

789
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,000
Yes

790
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,700
Weep!
Weep for the Jews,

791
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,800
the murderers of our Lord.

792
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,600
Because God ...

793
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,400
God has already condemned.

794
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,900
It is God will..

795
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,200
<i> to live as slaves, </i>

796
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,900
cursed and exiled
until the end of time.

797
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,200
Damn and exiles!

798
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,400
Damn and exiles!

799
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,400
Damn and exiles!

800
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,200
Lady, do not stop, Lady.

801
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,700
Now whole the Jews
want revenge!

802
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,100
I'm afraid you do not understand
what is really happening.

803
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:27,200
<i> When this is over,
would be no more Jews in Alexandria. </i>

804
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,100
Sorry to interrupt like this.

805
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,900
Lady, you know risk
to coming here.

806
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,700
Where are the troops?

807
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,200
Why do not more soldiers
on the streets?

808
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,500
No army can contain
entire city.

809
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,300
Calling to the annihilation <i>
of Women and Children </i>

810
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,300
A bishop!

811
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,800
- A Christian!
Then lock him up.

812
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Prefect

813
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,500
You should have an arrested.

814
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,700
<i> not so easy. </i>

815
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,200
Lady,

816
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:15,100
Cyril knows we both share
the same faith.

817
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,000
<i> That place our prefect
in the </i>

818
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,600
<i> very out of position. </i>

819
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,600
If he defends the Jews,
half the city will rise

820
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,000
against this government.

821
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I see.

822
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,800
But if you do nothing now,

823
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,100
I believe that Cyril

824
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:39,700
will continue do the same thing
over and over again

825
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:45,000
until no people
for this government to govern.

826
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,400
How naive with me.

827
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,200
<i> How naive I was to think
with Jews. </i>

828
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,100
Jews out!

829
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,400
is the first kill them

830
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,400
and then buried them.

831
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,900
The Bishop of Cyrene.

832
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,900
- What is he doing here?
I'll find out

833
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,800
It's my little library
of Alexandria.

834
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,200
This is where I teach children.

835
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,300
A cone of Apollonius.

836
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:47,700
<i> Yes, I did it to teach
the four corners. </i>

837
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,200
<i> Circle, </i>

838
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,900
the ellipse ...

839
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,400
Orestes and should be here
by now.

840
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,700
The parabole

841
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,000
and hyperbola.

842
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,200
It's beautiful.

843
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,000
Often I look and wonder

844
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,000
why the circle co axis

845
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,900
<i> is such impure shapes. </i>

846
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,600
What i get to sit here
again

847
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,200
I bored you.

848
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,000
A long time not do nothing
to hit my head.

849
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,700
And there are more important issues
to deal with.

850
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:26,800
Forgive me.

851
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,300
Two Christians in the hands
of a pagan.

852
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,900
It's outrageous!

853
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,400
outrageous.

854
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:15,400
- How many?
I do not know, but it will stink.

855
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:22,900
Ammonium.

856
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,800
Does God speak to you?

857
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,600
All the time.

858
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,100
Ammonium> this, Ammonius that.
Ammonia, Ammonia, Ammonium ...''</i>

859
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,600
Today he spooked to me

860
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,900
<i> so quickly that I had to asking
slow down  </i>

861
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,700
Tell me something.

862
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,600
Did you ever think
what is taken?

863
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,400
Why?

864
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,600
who's forgiven,

865
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,900
but now,
I can not forgive.

866
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,600
Forgive?

867
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,400
Who?

868
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,800
Jews?

869
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,300
Jesus forgave on the cross.

870
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,600
Jesus was God

871
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,800
and only he can show
such leniency.

872
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,200
How dare you
to compare yourself to God?

873
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,300
Brother.

874
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,400
You're still alive.

875
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,700
Why?

876
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,400
Because it was

877
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,000
His will save us
on the stones.

878
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,500
God wants us here,
doing what we do.

879
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,100
To believe in that belief?

880
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,400
My Lord ...

881
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,500
<i> Cyril is very proud man. </i>

882
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,400
Agree to meet but will not discuss
the Jews, only discuss peace.

883
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,500
Peace?

884
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:27,300
My suggestion, as your humble adviser
in this case,

885
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,200
<i> you accept. </i>

886
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,400
Let peace be the first.

887
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,600
Lady, what do you think?
No..I ...

888
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,400
It does not seem very encouraging.

889
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,100
Why would I want to come
to see Orestes

890
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,800
<i>-without concrete proposals?
something else </i>

891
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,700
He want come to you.

892
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,700
Demands that you see in the Library

893
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,200
during the service on Sunday.

894
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,700
In the Library?
Why?

895
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,800
Only Christians have entered
there since its looting.

896
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
It is a provocation!

897
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,500
<i> I'll make a suggestion. </i>

898
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,800
If you think that your presence

899
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,200
so essential

900
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,300
Why not let you baptize?

901
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,000
Most of us,
beginning

902
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,800
<i> by the prefect,
have accepted Christ. </i>

903
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,900
Why not the rest of you?

904
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,000
only a matter of time and you know it!

905
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,300
Really?

906
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,500
Is it only a matter of time?

907
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,900
Excuse me,

908
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,800
Honorable Member
but far time away..

909
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,100
your God has not yet proved

910
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:38,400
more judge or more compassionate
than their predecessors.

911
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,200
Lady.

912
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,000
<i> Is it really just a matter of time
before I accept your faith? </i>

913
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,400
Why, then,

914
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,500
should this assembly

915
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,400
accept the consult of
someone who ability dilution

916
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,600
absolutely nothing?

917
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,500
I believe in philosophy.

918
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,800
Philosophy.

919
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,200
Just what we need

920
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,100
in such times.

921
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,400
Enough!

922
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,200
I've been studying

923
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,400
absolutely no life.
for my own

924
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,800
And I wonder

925
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,600
wow.
- Forget about what i said today.

926
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,700
Is all
life holds for me?

927
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,100
What else?

928
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,600
I doubt anyone can see 

929
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,200
as devoted wife

930
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,400
and mother.

931
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,300
I think ...

932
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:54,800
I think the whole city
know the history of the handkerchief.

933
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,500
So ...

934
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,800
My father loved that one.

935
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,700
Even <i> he ...</i>

936
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,300
Who have the loved?

937
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,100
Except you,

938
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,400
Lebanon.

939
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,100
If only I could ...

940
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,400
fathom this ...

941
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,000
a little more.

942
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:45,000
<i> And get a little closer
the response, </i>

943
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,200
<i> then ...</i>

944
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,500
enough go to grave, happy.

945
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:54,800
Why?

946
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,300
Why that's mean so much to you?

947
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,400
Right now,

948
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,300
this every second,
whole earth could be moving

949
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,500
and no one realized it.

950
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,100
<i> Except you and me </i>

951
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,500
Believe me Lady, it's best
that nobody notices.

952
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,200
Really not it important?

953
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,800
i Do not understand why you insist
moving the ground they walk on.

954
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,100
Dress yourself
what happened on the boat.

955
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:26,100
Yes i dit,But that does not mean
this sailing on the earth moves.

956
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,400
<i> What if it does </i>

957
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Hypatia, look around.

958
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,500
Death,

959
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:33,900
horror

960
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,400
destruction.

961
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,200
<i> If the stars move in
the Circle, </i>

962
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,100
<i> why they share
perfection with us </i>

963
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,500
So we are not moving.

964
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,100
In circle.

965
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,800
We do not move ...

966
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,700
<i> circle. </i>

967
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,100
We move in circles.

968
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,400
Since Plato,

969
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,200
all of them: Aristarchus
Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

970
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:15,100
all have tried
reconcile their observations

971
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,100
<i> with circular orbits. </i>

972
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,600
<i> but What happen
otherwise hidden </i>

973
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,500
Another way?

974
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,700
Lady, There is no purer than the
circle, you yourself have taught us.

975
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,800
I know, but suppose

976
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,100
that the purity

977
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:32,900
the circle
prevented us from seeing beyond.

978
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,100
Just like the sunshine
prevents us from seeing

979
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,800
stars.

980
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,900
I must begin again

981
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,400
with new eyes.

982
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,100
I have to rethink everything.

983
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,600
All.

984
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,600
Reading the first letter
Paul to Timothy.

985
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,600
I therefore wish
that everywhere

986
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,200
men would lift their prayers

987
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,800
without anger or disputes.

988
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,400
Equally,

989
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,000
that women desire

990
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,500
dress modestly,

991
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,400
decency and propriety

992
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,000
without braids in her hair

993
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,100
or gold or pearls

994
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,100
or expensive clothes,

995
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,500
-but with good deeds.''
- Why read this passage?

996
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:41,300
I do not know, I promise
which is not agreed.

997
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,300
Let the woman learn

998
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,700
<i> quiet and full submission,
i can't allow a woman </i>

<i> of the same circle </i>

1163
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,100
That is impossible, mistress.

1164
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,900
wait what we know about the circle?
We know that center of the circles

1165
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,700
<i> is always same distance to any point
its perimeter. </i>

1166
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:56,900
<i> Exactly.
Yes. </i>

1167
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,600
What if the center divided into two

1168
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:03,800
<i> but keep constant the sum
distances to its perimeter </i>

1169
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:09,200
Okay, I'll show you what.
As I move this rod along

1170
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,500
the rope,
a segment increases

1171
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,800
and the other decreases.
And vice versa.

1172
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:16,900
Thus the sum of the two always..

1173
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,000
constant. You see that?

1174
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,600
We apply this, to the movement

1175
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,900
Earth?

1176
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,600
What ...

1177
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:44,900
will be ...

1178
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,300
obtained ?

1179
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:52,100
An ellipse!

1180
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:56,300
<i> An ellipse with the sun
in one focus. </i>

1181
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,300
Because,

1182
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,600
<i> what is the circle but </i>

1183
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,700
special ellipse

1184
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:07,400
<i> whose foci are so close
to get that seem one </i>

1185
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,300
complete and ready, Aspasia.

1186
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:17,800
i mean That is, what is this?
Maybe i just .. ..

1187
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:19,700
Perhaps you ...

1188
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,000
What do you think?

1189
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,600
This could be solved, mistress.

1190
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,900
Well done, we will
with this tomorrow.

1191
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,000
Get some sleep.

1192
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,500
Good night, mistress.
Good night.

1193
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,800
Thank you.

1194
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,200
Davo!

1195
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:12,700
Davo!

1196
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:18,200
What are you doing?

1197
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:41,800
Lady.

1198
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,900
Let me see.

1199
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,500
Why do not you sit down?

1200
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,500
Where is everybody?

1201
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,100
Please sit down.

1202
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:56,100
I have..

1203
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:57,900
I have news too.

1204
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,300
All the dignitaries

1205
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,700
that have not yet embraced
Christian faith

1206
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:11,800
should be baptized

1207
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:14,200
in public.

1208
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,000
The aim very clear:

1209
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:24,600
add to our cause
all Christians in the city,

1210
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,100
<i> decent people, better </i>

1211
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:31,500
to fight for me.

1212
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,700
You speak of battling faith.

1213
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:42,800
Okay.

1214
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Okay.

1215
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:53,000
It's seem already decided, I do not understand
to that required my presence here.

1216
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,000
I'm not a member of the government.

1217
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,900
<i>no you're more than that.
You are the person that i trust most, </i>

1218
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:15,200
and everyone knows it.

1219
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:17,200
It might say that.

1220
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,400
Lady.

1221
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,100
<i> years ago ...</i>

1222
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,400
Years ago you taught us something.

1223
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,600
<i> If ...</i>

1224
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:40,000
If two are

1225
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,900
<i> equal to one another, </i>

1226
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:44,200
all are equal to each other.
Do you remember?

1227
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,200
Yes

1228
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:48,000
All three of us, we are good people!

1229
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:51,400
And you are so Christian
as we are!

1230
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,800
Synesius, no doubt question
that you believe.

1231
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:02,400
<i> You can not do. </i>

1232
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,100
I must do.

1233
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:16,400
Well ...

1234
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,500
For it is a pity,

1235
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:21,800
lady.

1236
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,600
A great pity.

1237
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,300
Our revered teacher

1238
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:30,100
get away from what
yourself taught

1239
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,700
<i> Or do you think I know the madness
that plots </i>

1240
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:36,900
- Synesius!
The Earth revolves around the sun.

1241
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,900
What next?

1242
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,900
you must let me go.

1243
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:45,100
Let me in!

1244
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:47,700
- I talk to her!
- A parabolans?

1245
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:50,700
- Lady!
Go away before they arrested you.

1246
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,300
- Go!
- Aspasius!

1247
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,300
I, Davo. I Davo!
Let me go.

1248
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:58,300
<i> - Tell them who I am!
- Do you know this man? </i>

1249
01:45:58,500 --> 01:45:59,900
Yes What do you want?

1250
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,500
I need to talk to her.
Where is she?

1251
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:05,100
Mistress is not here.
- It is so urgent! Where is she?

1252
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,100
<i> she is in the prefect palace. </i>

1253
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,000
- Where?
- The prefect palace!

1254
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:11,700
The palace. Thank you.
-Get out of here.

1255
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,200
Who was that?

1256
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,300
It was a slave once .

1257
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:26,100
Wait, please!
i beg you

1258
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:39,600
If you not agree,
I can no longer protect you.

1259
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
..a word bible too, have feeling
with you. 

1260
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,100
......

1261
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:51,000
Hypatia.

1262
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:53,800
Do not you see?

1263
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,800
I can not go without you.

1264
01:46:58,100 --> 01:46:59,200
I can not.

1265

<i> Without you I can't beat Cyril. </i>

1266

Orestes.

1267
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,100
Cyril has already won.

1268
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:36,300
Thank you.

1269
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:38,200
I do not need you.

01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,600
Davo!

1271

Brother! Where are you going?

1272
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:13,000
We found her!

1273
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,900
Whore, walk!

Witch!

1277
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,300
Pagan scum!

1278
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:34,500
Walk! Come on!

1279
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,800
Witch!

1280
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,500
Strip her!

1281
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,400
Get up.

1282
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:17,700
That's it .So the God can be hold
in all your filthy, whore.

1283
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,200
the way you knock ...

1284
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,200
- ..The prefect so hard?
- Pagan!

1285
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:22,900
whore.

1286
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,000
look,

1287
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,300
she's not reacting.

1288
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:28,700
she's scream all right
with the skin on the knife. </i>

1289
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,200
<i> - How many of you have a knife?
- None </i>

1290
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,300
Do not stand your hands
with impure blood.

1291
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,000
Lets cool her!

1292
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,200
This witch get some stones.

1293
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:46,600
- Quickly!
Whatever we threw Orestes

1294
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:48,000
he still here.

1295
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,300
<i> I'll stay with her. </i>

1296
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:52,600
She has fainted. 

1297
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:24,900
The body of Hipatia was mutilated
and the remains...

1298
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:26,900
...were dragged through the streets 
and burned in a fire.

1299
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,900
Orestes was outlawed forever 
and Cirilo...

1300
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:31,900
...took control of the power
in Alexandria.

1301
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:39,900
Later, Cirilo was declared a Saint
and Doctor of the Church.

1302
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:46,900
Although not any of Hipatia works 
remains,

1303
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,900
it is known that she was an 
exceptional astronomer,

1304
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:51,800
well-known for the mathematical 
study of conical curves.

1305
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,900
One thousand, two hundred years later,

1306
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:00,900
in the 17th century, astronomer
Johannes Kepler...

1307
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:02,900
...described that one of those curves,...

1308
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:04,900
...the ellipse, governs the movement 
of the planets.
